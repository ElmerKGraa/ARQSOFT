# Project P1 - Architecture Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains the complete architecture documentation for the Library Management System following the Attribute-Driven Design (ADD) methodology.

## Document Structure

### 1. System-as-is (Reverse Engineering)
- [Architecture Overview](./01-Architecture-Overview.md) - High-level system architecture
- [Component View](./02-Component-View.md) - System components and their interactions
- [Deployment View](./03-Deployment-View.md) - Runtime and deployment architecture

### 2. Requirements
- [Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASR)](./04-ASR.md) - Key requirements driving architectural decisions
- [Quality Attributes](./05-Quality-Attributes.md) - System quality attributes and scenarios

### 3. ADD Process Documentation
- [ADD Methodology](./06-ADD-Methodology.md) - Application of Attribute-Driven Design
- [Architectural Tactics](./07-Architectural-Tactics.md) - Tactics used to achieve quality attributes
- [Reference Architectures](./08-Reference-Architectures.md) - Architectural styles and patterns applied
- [Architectural Patterns](./09-Architectural-Patterns.md) - Design patterns employed
- [Design Alternatives](./10-Design-Alternatives.md) - Alternative designs and rationale

## Diagrams
All architectural diagrams are provided in PlantUML format for consistency with existing project documentation.
