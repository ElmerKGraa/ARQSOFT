## Presentation Structure (20 minutes)

### Part 1: Introduction (2 minutes)

**Opening statement**:

> "I've created comprehensive architecture documentation for the Library Management System through reverse engineering of the implemented codebase. My work includes:
> - **1 ASR document** with 18 architecturally significant requirements and 5 major architectural decisions
> - **2 requirements documents**: 44 functional requirements and 30 non-functional requirements
> - **4 architecture diagrams** at different abstraction levels
> - **1 domain-specific deep-dive** on the genre classification system
> - **Complete traceability** from requirements to implementation
>
> All documentation follows industry standards: ISO/IEC 25010 for quality attributes, UML for diagrams, and C4 model for system visualization."

**Show**: Open [README.md](README.md) to show the index

---

### Part 2: The System Overview (3 minutes)

**Script**:

> "Let me start with the big picture. This is a **layered architecture** with **7 domain modules**."

**Show**: [SystemArchitecture.puml](SystemArchitecture.puml) diagram

**Explain**:

> "The system has three layers:
> 1. **Presentation Layer** (API Controllers) - handles HTTP requests
> 2. **Business Layer** (Services) - contains business logic and rules
> 3. **Data Layer** (Repositories) - handles database access
>
> Each of the 7 domain modules follows this same pattern: Author, Book, Reader, Lending, Genre, User, and Authentication.
>
> This consistency is intentional - once you understand one module, you understand all of them."

**Key point**: Emphasize the **consistent structure** across modules

---

### Part 3: Tracing a Request (5 minutes)

**Script**:

> "Let me show you how a request flows through the system. I'll trace **creating a new author** from start to finish."

**Show**: Open IDE, navigate through layers

**Trace** (show each file):

1. **HTTP Request arrives**:
   ```
   POST /api/authors
   Authorization: Bearer <JWT token>
   { "name": "Isaac Asimov", "bio": "..." }
   ```

2. **Security Layer** [SecurityConfig.java:119](../../src/main/java/pt/psoft/g1/psoftg1/configuration/SecurityConfig.java#L119):
   > "First, Spring Security checks the JWT token and verifies the user has LIBRARIAN role. If not, request stops here with 403 Forbidden."

3. **Presentation Layer** [AuthorController.java](../../src/main/java/pt/psoft/g1/psoftg1/authormanagement/api/AuthorController.java):
   > "Controller receives the request, validates the input using Jakarta Bean Validation, then delegates to the service layer. Notice: no business logic here, just coordination."

4. **Business Layer** [AuthorServiceImpl.java](../../src/main/java/pt/psoft/g1/psoftg1/authormanagement/services/AuthorServiceImpl.java):
   > "Service contains all business rules: checking forbidden names, handling photo upload, creating the domain entity. This is where business logic lives."

5. **Domain Model** [Author.java](../../src/main/java/pt/psoft/g1/psoftg1/authormanagement/model/Author.java):
   > "The Author entity validates itself in the constructor. Using value objects like Name and Bio, which have their own validation rules. This is **Domain-Driven Design** - the domain objects are 'smart', not just data bags."

6. **Data Layer** [AuthorRepository.java](../../src/main/java/pt/psoft/g1/psoftg1/authormanagement/repositories/AuthorRepository.java):
   > "Repository saves to database. Notice it's just an interface - Spring Data JPA generates the implementation and SQL automatically."

**Conclude**:
> "This flow demonstrates **separation of concerns**. Each layer has one job, making the code testable, maintainable, and easy to understand."

---

### Part 4: Key Architectural Decisions (5 minutes)

**Script**:

> "Every architectural decision involves trade-offs. I've documented 5 major decisions with their rationale and alternatives considered."

**Show**: [ASR-ArchitecturallySignificantRequirements.md - Architectural Decisions section](ASR-ArchitecturallySignificantRequirements.md#architectural-decisions)

**Highlight 3 decisions**:

#### Decision 1: Layered Architecture

> "**Why layered architecture and not microservices?**
>
> **Choice**: 3-layer (N-tier) architecture
>
> **Alternatives considered**:
> - Microservices: Rejected due to unnecessary complexity for this project scope
> - Hexagonal architecture: Rejected as overly complex for educational timeline
>
> **Rationale**:
> - Suitable for small team (1-5 developers)
> - Clear structure for learning
> - Appropriate complexity for library domain
> - All components deployed as single unit (simpler deployment)
>
> **Trade-off**: Can't scale individual layers independently, but this isn't needed for a library system."

**Show**: Point to [AD-01 in ASR document](ASR-ArchitecturallySignificantRequirements.md#ad-01-selection-of-layered-architecture)

---

#### Decision 2: JWT with RSA

> "**Why JWT tokens instead of traditional sessions?**
>
> **Choice**: JWT with RSA asymmetric encryption
>
> **Alternatives considered**:
> - Session-based authentication: Rejected due to scalability limitations
> - JWT with HMAC: Considered but RSA provides better security
>
> **Rationale**:
> - **Stateless**: Server doesn't store sessions, enables horizontal scaling
> - **Security**: RSA provides strong cryptographic security
> - **RESTful**: Aligns with REST principles (stateless)
> - **Industry standard**: Modern APIs use tokens
>
> **Trade-off**: Can't revoke individual tokens (until expiration), but this is acceptable for the educational context and typical use cases."

**Show**: Point to [AD-02](ASR-ArchitecturallySignificantRequirements.md#ad-02-jwt-with-rsa-keys-for-authentication) and [SecurityConfig.java](../../src/main/java/pt/psoft/g1/psoftg1/configuration/SecurityConfig.java)

---

#### Decision 3: Optimistic Locking

> "**Why optimistic locking instead of pessimistic database locks?**
>
> **Choice**: Optimistic locking with `@Version` annotation
>
> **Alternatives considered**:
> - Pessimistic locking (database locks): Rejected due to performance impact
> - No concurrency control: Rejected due to lost update risk
>
> **Rationale**:
> - **Performance**: No database locks, better throughput
> - **User experience**: No waiting for locks
> - **Conflict rarity**: Librarians rarely edit same book simultaneously
> - **Clear feedback**: User gets clear error message to refresh
>
> **Implementation**: Every mutable entity has a `version` field. When updating, we check if the version matches. If someone else updated first, we reject with conflict error."

**Show**: Point to version fields in [Book.java:27-29](../../src/main/java/pt/psoft/g1/psoftg1/bookmanagement/model/Book.java#L27-L29)

---

### Part 5: Requirements Documentation (3 minutes)

**Script**:

> "I extracted all requirements from the implemented codebase, creating complete traceability."

**Show**: Open [FunctionalRequirements.md](FunctionalRequirements.md)

**Explain**:

> "**Functional Requirements** (what the system does):
> - **44 requirements** across 7 modules
> - Each requirement includes:
>   - Unique ID (e.g., FR-AUT-01)
>   - Actor (who can perform it)
>   - Priority (High/Medium/Low)
>   - REST API endpoint
>   - Implementation evidence with code references
>   - Link to use case documentation
>
> For example, **FR-AUT-01: Create Author**:
> - Actor: Librarian
> - API: POST /api/authors
> - Implementation: AuthorController.java, AuthorServiceImpl.java, Author.java
> - Business rules: Forbidden name validation, photo size limit
> - Use case: A3/B3 from Phase 2
>
> **100% implementation coverage** - all Phase 1 and Phase 2 use cases are implemented."

**Show**: Navigate to one specific requirement to demonstrate detail

**Show**: Open [NonFunctionalRequirements.md](NonFunctionalRequirements.md)

**Explain**:

> "**Non-Functional Requirements** (quality attributes):
> - **30 requirements** organized by ISO/IEC 25010 quality model
> - Categories: Security (7), Performance (5), Reliability (4), Maintainability (5), Usability (4), Scalability (2), Portability (2), Compliance (3), Interoperability (3)
>
> Each NFR includes:
> - Measurement criteria (how to verify)
> - Implementation evidence
> - Status (fully/partially/not implemented)
>
> For example, **NFR-SEC-01: JWT Authentication**:
> - Priority: Critical
> - Requirement: Use JWT with RSA encryption
> - Measurement: JWT tokens generated with RSA-512, validation on every protected endpoint
> - Status: ✅ Fully implemented
> - Evidence: SecurityConfig.java lines 179-191"

---

### Part 6: Genre Classification Deep-Dive (2 minutes)

**Script**:

> "To demonstrate system analysis skills, I created a deep-dive on the **Genre Classification System**."

**Show**: Open [GenreClassificationSystem.md](GenreClassificationSystem.md)

**Explain**:

> "This document includes:
> - **Current system analysis**: Single genre per book, flat structure, no hierarchy
> - **Business rules**: Genre name validation, uniqueness constraints
> - **7 API operations**: Top 5 genres, average lendings per genre, trends over time
> - **Analytics capabilities**: What reports the system can generate
>
> **Critical analysis** - I identified limitations:
> - Books can only have one genre (real books often span multiple genres)
> - No genre hierarchy (can't have sub-genres like 'Hard Sci-Fi' under 'Science Fiction')
> - No public API for genre management (librarians can't add genres without code changes)
>
> **Enhancement recommendations** - I proposed **8 prioritized improvements**:
>
> **Priority 1** (High Value):
> 1. Hierarchical genre classification (parent-child relationships)
> 2. Multiple genres per book (many-to-many relationship)
> 3. Genre management API (CRUD operations for genres)
>
> Each enhancement includes:
> - Problem statement
> - Proposed solution with code examples
> - Database impact
> - Effort estimate
> - Risk assessment"

**Key point**: This shows you can analyze, critique, and propose improvements - not just document what exists.

---

## Part 7: Demonstration of Traceability (2 minutes)

**Script**:

> "One strength of this documentation is **complete traceability**. Let me demonstrate."

**Pick a feature, show the chain**:

> "Take **'Top 5 Authors by Lending Count'**:
>
> **Use Case**: B6 (Phase 2)
> - Documented in: [Phase2/WP2B-Authors/US006.md](../Phase2/WP2B-Authors/)
>
> **Functional Requirement**: FR-REPORT-01
> - Documented in: [FunctionalRequirements.md - Top 5 Authors](FunctionalRequirements.md#fr-report-01-top-5-authors)
>
> **API Endpoint**: GET /api/authors/top5
> - Documented in: [RestMapping.md line 24](../Phase2/RestMapping.md)
> - Secured: [SecurityConfig.java:124](../../src/main/java/pt/psoft/g1/psoftg1/configuration/SecurityConfig.java#L124) - Reader role required
>
> **Implementation**:
> - Controller: [AuthorController.java](../../src/main/java/pt/psoft/g1/psoftg1/authormanagement/api/AuthorController.java) - getTop5Authors()
> - Service: [AuthorServiceImpl.java](../../src/main/java/pt/psoft/g1/psoftg1/authormanagement/services/AuthorServiceImpl.java) - getTop5()
> - Repository: [AuthorRepository.java](../../src/main/java/pt/psoft/g1/psoftg1/authormanagement/repositories/AuthorRepository.java) - custom query
>
> **Test**: AuthorServiceTest.java (test file exists)
>
> **You can trace from business need → requirement → implementation → test** - full lifecycle."

## Handling Questions

### Expected Questions and Answers

#### Q1: "How long did this take?"

**Answer**:
> "The analysis and documentation took approximately **15-20 hours** over several days:
> - **Code analysis**: 5-6 hours (reading 144 Java files, identifying patterns)
> - **Diagram creation**: 3-4 hours (4 PlantUML diagrams at different levels)
> - **ASR documentation**: 4-5 hours (identifying 18 ASRs, documenting decisions)
> - **Requirements extraction**: 4-5 hours (44 FRs + 30 NFRs with traceability)
> - **Genre deep-dive**: 2-3 hours (analysis + enhancement recommendations)
>
> This demonstrates significant effort and thorough analysis."

---

#### Q2: "How did you learn to do this?"

**Answer**:
> "I applied concepts from our software architecture course:
> - **Architectural styles** (layered, component-based, microservices)
> - **Quality attributes** (using ISO/IEC 25010 framework)
> - **Architectural views** (4+1 model: component, deployment, etc.)
> - **Design patterns** (Repository, Service, DDD patterns)
>
> I also referenced industry standards:
> - **UML** for diagrams
> - **C4 Model** for system visualization
> - **ISO/IEC 25010** for quality attributes
>
> The key was **applying theory to real code** - reverse engineering helped me understand concepts practically."

---

#### Q3: "What's the most important architectural decision?"

**Answer**:
> "The **layered architecture** (AD-01) is foundational because:
> 1. It affects every other decision (modularity, testability, deployment)
> 2. It determines how developers work (where to put code)
> 3. It impacts quality attributes (maintainability, scalability)
>
> This decision enabled:
> - **Maintainability**: Each layer has one responsibility
> - **Testability**: Layers can be tested independently
> - **Scalability**: Stateless design allows horizontal scaling (limited by database)
> - **Understandability**: Clear structure for new developers
>
> The trade-off is that we can't scale individual layers independently (unlike microservices), but for a library system with moderate load, this is acceptable."

---

#### Q4: "What would you change if you were designing this from scratch?"

**Answer**:
> "I'd keep most decisions but consider these changes:
>
> **Keep**:
> - Layered architecture (appropriate for scope)
> - JWT authentication (modern, scalable)
> - Domain-Driven Design (aligns code with business)
> - Optimistic locking (good performance)
>
> **Change**:
> 1. **Database**: Start with PostgreSQL instead of H2 (production-ready)
> 2. **API Versioning**: Design with versioning from day 1 (e.g., /api/v1/)
> 3. **Audit Logging**: Build in from start (easier than retrofitting)
> 4. **Genre System**: Multiple genres per book from beginning (harder to change later)
>
> These are documented in my recommendations sections with effort estimates."

---

#### Q5: "How does this compare to real-world systems?"

**Answer**:
> "This architecture is **very similar to real-world systems** in:
> - **Pattern usage**: Layered architecture is industry standard for web APIs
> - **Technology choices**: Spring Boot + JWT + JPA is common stack
> - **Design principles**: SOLID, DDD, separation of concerns
>
> **Differences from enterprise systems**:
> - **Scale**: Enterprise might use microservices for independent scaling
> - **Database**: Would use PostgreSQL/Oracle, not H2
> - **Monitoring**: Would have observability (logs, metrics, tracing)
> - **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines
> - **API Gateway**: Might have API gateway for rate limiting, caching
>
> But the **core principles** are the same. This is a solid foundation that could evolve to enterprise scale."

---

#### Q6: "What did you learn from this exercise?"

**Answer**:
> "Three key learnings:
>
> 1. **Reading code ≠ Understanding architecture**
>    - You need to step back, identify patterns, see the big picture
>    - Architecture is about relationships and trade-offs, not just code
>
> 2. **Every decision has trade-offs**
>    - No 'perfect' architecture, only appropriate choices for context
>    - Understanding WHY is more important than knowing WHAT
>
> 3. **Documentation is crucial**
>    - Without documentation, architectural knowledge lives only in developers' heads
>    - Good documentation enables onboarding, maintenance, and evolution
>
> This exercise taught me to think like an architect, not just a programmer."

---

#### Q7: "How would you improve the genre classification system?"

**Answer**:
> "I documented **8 enhancements** in priority order. Let me focus on top 3:
>
> **1. Hierarchical genre classification** (Priority 1):
> - **Problem**: Flat structure limits expressiveness
> - **Solution**: Parent-child relationships (Science Fiction → Hard Sci-Fi, Space Opera)
> - **Implementation**: Add `parent_genre_pk` foreign key to Genre table
> - **Benefit**: Better browsing (drill-down), more accurate classification
> - **Effort**: 2-3 days
>
> **2. Multiple genres per book** (Priority 1):
> - **Problem**: Books often span multiple genres
> - **Solution**: Change from many-to-one to many-to-many
> - **Implementation**: New BOOK_GENRE join table
> - **Benefit**: More accurate, better search recall
> - **Effort**: 3-4 days (includes data migration)
>
> **3. Genre management API** (Priority 1):
> - **Problem**: No API to add/edit genres (requires code changes)
> - **Solution**: RESTful CRUD endpoints for genres
> - **Implementation**: New GenreController methods (POST, PATCH, DELETE)
> - **Benefit**: Librarians can manage genres without developer
> - **Effort**: 2-3 days
>
> All enhancements include **implementation examples** and **database impact analysis**."

---

#### Q8: "What patterns did you identify?"

**Answer**:
> "I identified **7 key patterns**:
>
> **Architectural patterns**:
> 1. **Layered Architecture** (3-tier): Presentation → Business → Data
> 2. **Domain-Driven Design**: Aggregates, Value Objects, Ubiquitous Language
>
> **Design patterns**:
> 3. **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
> 4. **Service Pattern**: Business logic encapsulation
> 5. **DTO Pattern**: Data transfer between layers
> 6. **Value Object Pattern**: Immutable, self-validating domain concepts
> 7. **Dependency Injection**: Spring IoC container
>
> Each pattern is documented with:
> - Purpose and benefits
> - Implementation examples
> - Location in codebase
>
> These patterns work together to create a **clean, maintainable architecture**."

---

### Difficult Questions (Advanced)

#### Q: "Why not use microservices?"

**Answer**:
> "Microservices have benefits but also significant costs. For this project:
>
> **Microservices would add**:
> - Inter-service communication (REST/gRPC/messaging)
> - Distributed transactions (eventual consistency challenges)
> - Service discovery and orchestration
> - Multiple deployments to manage
> - Network latency between services
> - More complex testing
>
> **Our requirements don't need**:
> - Independent scaling (entire library system loads uniformly)
> - Independent deployment (updates are coordinated)
> - Technology diversity (Java throughout is fine)
> - Team independence (single team, not multiple teams)
>
> **Cost-benefit analysis**: Microservices add 3-4x complexity for benefits we don't need.
>
> **When to use microservices**:
> - Large teams (50+ developers)
> - Different scaling needs (e.g., book search gets 100x more traffic than admin)
> - Need for technology diversity (some services in Python, some in Java)
>
> **For this project**: Monolith (with modular structure) is the right choice."

---

#### Q: "How would this scale to 1 million users?"

**Answer**:
> "To scale to 1M users, I'd make these changes:
>
> **1. Database** (bottleneck):
> - Migrate from H2 to PostgreSQL with read replicas
> - Add caching layer (Redis) for frequent queries
> - Database connection pooling (tune pool size)
> - Index optimization on frequent queries
>
> **2. Application Servers** (easy with stateless JWT):
> - Run multiple instances behind load balancer
> - No session sharing needed (stateless)
> - Horizontal scaling works immediately
>
> **3. File Storage**:
> - Move from local file system to S3/CloudStorage
> - Use CDN for photo delivery
>
> **4. Monitoring**:
> - Add APM (Application Performance Monitoring)
> - Log aggregation (ELK stack)
> - Metrics (Prometheus/Grafana)
>
> **5. Caching Strategy**:
> - Cache top 5 reports (refresh every 5 minutes)
> - Cache genre list (rarely changes)
> - Cache book catalog with TTL
>
> **Current architecture supports this** because:
> - Stateless (can add servers easily)
> - Layered (can add caching without changing business logic)
> - Repository pattern (can switch database without changing services)
>
> The **core architecture remains the same**, we just add infrastructure."

## Success Indicators

### You're Doing Well If...

✅ Teacher is nodding
✅ Teacher asks clarifying questions (not critical ones)
✅ Teacher asks about specific technical details
✅ Teacher asks "What would you do if...?" (hypotheticals)
✅ Teacher asks you to explain to another student (teaching opportunity)

### Warning Signs

⚠️ Teacher looks confused (slow down, use simpler language)
⚠️ Teacher is silent (ask "Does this make sense?" or "Would you like me to elaborate?")
⚠️ Teacher challenges a decision (stay calm, explain trade-offs, reference documentation)

---

## Post-Meeting

### Immediate Actions

1. **Note feedback**: Write down teacher's suggestions
2. **Update documentation**: If teacher identified gaps, note for updates
3. **Thank teacher**: "Thank you for your time and feedback"

### If Teacher Suggests Improvements

**Response**:
> "Thank you for that feedback. I'll add it to my enhancement recommendations section with your suggestions. Would you like me to document that as a priority improvement?"

**Don't be defensive** - good documentation evolves with feedback.

---

## Emergency Responses

### If Technology Fails

**Backup plan**:
1. Have documentation on phone/tablet
2. Can present without computer (explain diagrams verbally)
3. Offer to reschedule if critical demo needed

### If You Blank on a Question

**Script**:
> "That's a good question. Let me think for a moment..."
> [Pause to collect thoughts]
> "Based on my analysis... [answer]"
>
> Or:
> "I documented that in [specific document]. Let me pull it up... [show documentation]"

### If Teacher Disagrees with a Decision

**Script**:
> "That's an interesting perspective. Let me explain the trade-offs I considered:
> - Option A had these benefits [X] but these costs [Y]
> - Option B had these benefits [Z] but these costs [W]
> - I chose [X] because [rationale]
>
> What would you recommend given these constraints?"

**Turn it into a discussion**, not an argument.
